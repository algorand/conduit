# Conduit Plugins

Functionality can be added by implementing plugins. Once a new plugin is registered with
the framework it can be configured exactly like the built-in Conduit plugins by using
the `conduit.yml` file.

There are three different interfaces to implement depending on
what sort of functionality you are adding:

* Importer: for sourcing data into the system.
* Processor: for manipulating data as it goes through the system.
* Exporter: for sending processed data somewhere.

All plugins should be implemented in the respective `importers`, `processors`, or `exporters` package.

For interface details, refer to the godoc:

* [Importer](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/algorand/conduit/conduit/plugins/importers)
* [Processor](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/algorand/conduit/conduit/plugins/processors)
* [Exporter](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/algorand/conduit/conduit/plugins/exporters)

# Creating A Plugin

Plugin templates are available at our
[conduit-plugin-template](https://github.com/algorand/conduit-plugin-template) repository.
It is the quickest way to get up and running as it provides you with all the boilerplate
code and some sample build scripts.

## Registering a plugin

### Register the Constructor

The constructor is registered to the system by name in the init. This is how the configuration is able to dynamically create pipelines. For example:

```go
func init() {
	exporters.RegisterExporter(noopExporterMetadata.ExpName, exporters.ExporterConstructorFunc(func() exporters.Exporter {
		return &noopExporter{}
	}))
}
```

There are similar interfaces for each plugin type.

### Load the Plugin

Each plugin package contains an `all.go` file.
Adding an import statement for the plugin ensures that the plugin is registered by Conduit.
This occurs because the `init()` function (see previous) will be called at import time.

## Implement the interface

Generally speaking, you can follow the code in one of the existing plugins.

## Lifecycle

### Init

Each plugin will have its `Init` function called once as the pipeline is constructed.

The context provided to this function should be saved, and used to terminate any long-running operations if necessary.

### Per-round function

Each plugin type has a function termed the _Plugin Method_ which is called once per round:

* Importer: `GetBlock` is called when a particular round is required.
* Processor: `Process` is called to process a round.
* Exporter: `Receive` for consuming and typically persisting a round.

> NOTE: When a _Plugin Method_ returns an error, the pipeline will retry according to the configured `retry-count` employing a delay of `retry-delay`
> between tries. In most cases, it is recommended that you use Conduit's
> built-in retry mechanism rather than implementing your own.

### Close

Called during a graceful shutdown. We make every effort to call this function, but it is not guaranteed.

### Hooks

There are special lifecycle hooks that can be registered on any plugin by implementing additional interfaces.

#### RoundRequestor

```go
// RoundRequestor is an optional interface. Plugins should implement it if
// they would like to request an override to the pipeline managed round.
type RoundRequestor interface {
	// RoundRequest is called by the Conduit framework prior to `Init`.
	// This allows plugins with specific round requirements to override
	// the automatic round tracking provided by the Conduit pipeline.
	//
	// There are a few cases where this can be problematic. In these cases
	// an error will be generated and Conduit will fail to launch:
	// 1. Conduit is launched with --next-round-override
	// 2. Multiple plugins request a round override and the requested
	//    rounds are different.
	//
	// If it becomes common for multiple round overrides to be provided,
	// we will add an option to select which override to use. For example,
	// the override rule could be "command-line", "oldest", or the name
	// of a plugin which should be preferred.
	RoundRequest(config plugins.PluginConfig) (uint64, error)
}
```

#### Completed

When all processing has completed for a round, the `OnComplete` function is called on any plugin that implements it.

> NOTE: The error that `OnComplete()` returns is non-fatal and Conduit's pipeline will continue on to the next round.

```go
// Completed is called by the conduit pipeline after every exporter has
// finished. It can be used for things like finalizing state.
type Completed interface {
	// OnComplete will be called by the Conduit framework when the pipeline
	// finishes processing a round.
	OnComplete(input data.BlockData) error
}
```

#### PluginMetrics

After the pipeline has been initialized, and before it has been started, plugins may provide prometheus metric handlers.
The subsystem is a configurable value that should be passed into the Prometheus metric constructors.
The ProvideMetrics function will only be called once.

```go
// PluginMetrics is for defining plugin specific metrics
type PluginMetrics interface {
	ProvideMetrics(subsystem string) []prometheus.Collector
}
```
